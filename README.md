What I learned making this color clock:

#Javascript
* Learned how to use the setInterval command.
* Learned how to use the `new date()` function to get the current time.
* How to change a clock from military time to 12 hour time.
* How to change a page's background using Javascript.


#Sass
* How to nest id's and classes to make designing a page easier.
